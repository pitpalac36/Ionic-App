This app manages a reading list (each book identified by id, title, genre, reading starting date and whether or not the reading is over). It's currently able to :

  -> show a master-detail UI
  
  -> fetch data using a REST service
  
  -> send server-side notifications via web sockets
  
  -> authenticate users
  
  -> persist resources in the local storage
  
  -> provide pagination, searching & filtering

  -> provide offline support & show status (online/offline)
  
  -> allow user to take, upload, save photos
  
  -> use maps
